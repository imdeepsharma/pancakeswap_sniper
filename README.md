Feel free to fork modify and snap as many shit coin as you want as soon as liquidity is added

The sell function is not in use in the code.
To use it you must add profit amount you want the shitcoin to sell for and then call the function inside the loop event 
so that it monitors both
Currently it is monitoring only the pair creation event

Happy Snipping
